This project is still in development and might be very unstable for now.

I try to comment the source files and the template callbacks as much as
thought would be enough. A full content documentation, would soon be online.

What you need
-------------

It has been tested and work with:
 * Python <=2.6
 * Fabric 0.9.1
 * Xen 4.0.1 (with xen-utils)
