## TODO on sandcrawler project

- callbacks system has to be refactored:
    no more branch directly on trunk (monkey patching on self...)
    every object have:
        self.__trk => trunk class
        self.__mom => parent class

- fabric wrapper (fabric_wrp) api should be an object on server class
    calls should be done like this: server.fapi.run([...])
    server ip should be retrieved from server object (not an arg)

- maybe xen could become a callback instead of librarie
- xen librarie or callbacks have to be extend with methods to:
    set a domu in auto start
    [...]

- nginx callbacks (to be defined)
- apache2 callbacks (to be defined)
- mysql callbacks (to be defined)
- solr callbacks have to be extend with methods to:
    deploy && install it through tomcat6
    deploy && install in autonomous
    control solr configuration (XML)
    check availability
